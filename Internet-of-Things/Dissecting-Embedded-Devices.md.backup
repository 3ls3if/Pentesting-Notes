## UART

### UART Identification Test

- Locate the headers or pads you believe could be UART by inspecting
the board. (Seeing two to four pads/pins grouped together on the board is a good sign, but as mentioned earlier, they can be intermingled within
other functional pads/pins.)
- Discover the target voltage by probing the board with a multimeter or
identifying an IC and looking up the datasheet.
- Discover a ground that is easy to connect to by measuring resistance
(Ohms) between a known ground (such as the chassis ground) and pins
that are easy to connect to (effectively 0 Ohms between the known
ground and the pin in question).
- Connect the board to your JTAGulator if you are fortunate enough to
find headers, or solder a header to the board and then connect
- Verify the version of JTAGulator firmware . The version can be
checked against the code on the repository at
https://github.com/grandideastudio/jtagulator/releases. If the version is
not the latest, follow the directions at www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlXwy-weG1M.
- Enable UART mode and set the target voltage
- Run the UART identification test
- On success, look for reasonable responses such as carriage returns or line feeds (0D or 0A).
- Verify the identified settings by running in pass-thru mode with the baud rate candidate (57600 in our case).
