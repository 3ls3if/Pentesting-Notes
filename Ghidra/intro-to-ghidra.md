# Intro To Ghidra

## Installation and QuickStart

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk
```

[Download Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)

```
unzip <ghidra.zip> -d ~

cd ~/ghidra

./ghidraRun
```


## Create a Project

- Click on File | New or Ctrl+N
- Click File | Import to import the executables
- Click on Ok
- Double Click the Target file to launch the code browser and start the analysis

## Analysis

- Function Analyzer Assigns addresses and names to
functions based on their symbol reference or by detecting function prologues and epilogues in the code disassembly.
- Stack Analyzer Infers stack variable sizes and
references based on stack base and pointer operations at the beginning of the function.
- Operand Analyzer Assigns and resolves address and
symbol references based on scalar operands.
- Data Reference Analyzer Resolves addresses and
references to data values and obvious data types
based on their memory section location and operands
in the code.

## Code Browser

- Main menu: All the main options are available
from this menu.
- Toolbar: Here you will ﬁnd a group of icon buttons
you can use as shortcuts for common functionality.
- Program Trees: This provides tree lists of all the
memory segments deﬁned by the binary and will vary
depending on the binary format and loader.
- Symbol Tree: Here you can quickly navigate
through all the symbols deﬁned by the debugging
information or resolved by the initial analysis. These
symbols are separated by type: imports, exports,
functions, labels, classes, and namespaces.
- Data Type: Manager Built-in, generic, binary-
provided, and user-deﬁned data types will be available
here. You can easily navigate to operations on values
and references by their data type.
- Listing: The program’s code disassembly and data
references are listed here. You can easily explore
program logic, references, and address oﬀsets.
Special comments and named values generated by
the Ghidra loader and analyzer are displayed here as
well.
-Decompile: This window displays a C language
representation of the function selected on the Listing
window. This decompilation eases the process of
analyzing large and complex assembly code blocks.
- Console – Scripting: Results and outputs from
scripts and plug-ins are shown here.
